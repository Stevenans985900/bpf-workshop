# Terminals

Once in a while, the instructions will say:
<br/>"Open a new terminal."

There are multiple ways to do this:

- create a new window or tab on your machine, and SSH into the VM;

- use screen or tmux on the VM and open a new window from there;

- Or if you are executing in a local Linux machine just open a new terminal in there;

You are welcome to use the method that you feel the most comfortable with.
