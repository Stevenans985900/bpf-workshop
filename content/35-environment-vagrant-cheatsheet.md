# Vagrant

After cloning the workshop repository, enter the environment folder:

```
git clone https://github.com/bpftools/bpf-workshop.git
cd bpf-workshop/environment
```

Then there are three major things you can do:

```bash
# Start the environment
vagrant up

# Stop the environment
vagrant halt

# Destroy the environment
vagrant destroy

# Obtain a shell
vagrant ssh
```
