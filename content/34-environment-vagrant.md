# Vagrant

- If you don't know what Vagrant is, **don't worry**.
- It's just a tool to create Virtual machines that we use to create a common VM with all the eBPF tools for everyone!
- This workshop comes with a reference environment expressed in a `Vagrantfile`.
- You don't have to use this one, but be prepared to install stuff!
